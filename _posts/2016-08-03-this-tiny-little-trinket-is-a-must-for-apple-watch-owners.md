  A handy little portable Apple Watch charger just hit Kickstarter this month
  and it's an impressive piece of kit. The Diskus is the first portable
  Apple-approved Apple Watch Charger. More importantly it does away with the
  6-foot cable found on the official charger and replaces it with a micro USB
  port.
