  The physics equations you learned in school don't work on the atomic scale. We
  have Newtonian physics to explain the world we can see and feel, and we have
  Einsteinian physics to explain the behavior of matter and light in the
  universe, but we observe a bunch of bizarre phenomena on the atomic scale that
  we can't explain yet with equations and mathematical laws.
