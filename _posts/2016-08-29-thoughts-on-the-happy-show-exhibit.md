  Recently, a few of us went to the Design Exchange winter exhibit: Stefan
  Sagmeister, The Happy Show. There has been a lot of buzz this past year over
  Sagmeister's upcoming feature film The Happy Film. Couple this with the sneak
  peek we were given during Sagmeister's talk at Design Thinkers last year, and
  we were pretty stoked to go check it out.
