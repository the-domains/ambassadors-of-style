  n the beginning, AutoCAD was the same. Whether you used it for architecture,
  industrial design, mechanical design or electrical design, you used the same
  2D drafting and drawing features. Working with a product built for the widest
  possible horizontal, you learned to come up with creative solutions (or clumsy
  workarounds) to accomplish the tasks unique to your discipline, domain or
  niche.
